# FingerprintAttendanceMachineGUI
A GUI wrapper for [FingerprintAttendanceMachine](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/FingerprintAttendanceMachine).

The reason I've created this program is I found out that some people could not be comfortable with this device' serial commandline interface, so I've created this GUI wrapper in order to bring ease of usage.

(This program doesn't completely fulfil the need for a serial communication terminal program.)
